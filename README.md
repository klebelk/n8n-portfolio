## About
I specialize in building robust and efficient n8n automations that solve real-world problems. This portfolio showcases a collection of my workflows, demonstrating my ability to integrate various services, handle data transformations, and implement complex logic to streamline operations and enhance productivity.

## Featured Workflows

### 1. [Discudemy RSS to Discord Bot](workflows/discudemy-rss-discord)
Automated course deal aggregator with deduplication, coupon extraction, and Discord notifications.

**Skills**: RSS parsing, web scraping, conditional logic, data table operations, Discord API, regex pattern matching
**Use Case**: Content curation, community automation, real-time notifications

### 2. [GitHub Repository Monitor](workflows/github-repository-monitor)
Automated workflow that monitors specified GitHub repositories for new releases, summarizes their release notes using AI, and sends digests via email (Gmail) and Slack.

**Skills**: Scheduled automation, API integration (GitHub, OpenAI, Gmail, Slack), data persistence (n8n Data Tables), conditional logic, data transformation, AI/LLM integration
**Use Case**: Developer tools, project management, team communication, staying updated on open-source projects
