## About
Automation specialist building production-ready n8n workflows that solve real business problems. I focus on AI-powered content processing, intelligent data routing, and multi-platform integrations. Each workflow demonstrates clean architecture, proper error handling, and scalable design patterns.

**What I build:**
- Content aggregation & AI summarization systems
- Lead generation & CRM automation
- Real-time notification & monitoring workflows
- Multi-platform data synchronization

**My approach:** Start with the business problem, design for maintainability, deploy for reliability.
